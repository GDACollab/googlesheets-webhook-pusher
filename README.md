# Google Sheets Webhook Pusher
This is a collection of scripts you can add to any google sheets document to then modify and use to push webhooks. Here's how it works:

Step 1: Open a google sheets document.
Step 2: Go to Extensions->Apps Script
Step 3: Add Main.gs, sheetData.gs, webhookdata.gs, config.gs, and configPage.html to the apps script.
Step 4: Add named ranges according to Main.gs and webhookdata.gs, and modify the functions in Main.gs and webhookdata.gs according to their respective comments.
Step 5: That's it! This should be fairly self-explanatory (as long as you're familiar with code and the layout of spreadsheets). I would make improvements, but I have deadlines to meet.
